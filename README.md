## About it
DooT was inspired by ![this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJDVKeh7RJI) tutorial in freeCodeCamp by ![Rodeside Coder](https://github.com/piyush-eon).<br>
I would say it is custom enough to be considered a "fork" but in no way i would have done it without the tutorial, so thanks again to Roadside Coder.<br>
Altough im definetily making this available on my phone, its really cool and actually usefull.
